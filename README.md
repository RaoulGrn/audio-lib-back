# Audio Library - Backend

This project was made for the technical assessment of MMCTech. My task was to design and implement a digital music library, where youâ€™ll be able to visualize your artists and their albums with a description and their songs.
I also had to implement an autocomplete component that provides suggestions as a user enters a search box.
